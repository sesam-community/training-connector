# Tripletex

A Sesam connector for Tripletex

## Structure needed to make the connector workflow function

```
training-connector/
    .authconfig (Set CONSUMER_TOKEN & EMPLOYEE_TOKEN)
    .syncconfig (Set NODE & JWT)
    README.md
    manifest.json (Set and define which templates to use for datatypes)
    templates/

```

## General instruction when editing files.

You should not change the json files within the templates folder locally. The `manifest.json` file you can change locally to reflect which datatypes you want generated in your Sesam subscription when doing your development. 

## .authconfig
tripletex uses the format:

consumer_token=.....

employee_token=....


## Exercises
1. Collect the product data from Tripletex
   - What can be used as _id? How is that added to the entity? 
2. Insert a new Tripletex product (you will need to repost and edit an entity to do this)
   - How to construct a REST operation? How does the share entity need to be edited in order to provoke an insert?
   - To insert an entity the $origin property must be present and the primary_key must be missing 
3. Update the Tripletex product you inserted (you will need to repost and edit an entity to do this)
   - How does a share entity need to be edited to provoke an update? What happens in the share template before the actual update REST operation?
   - To update an entity you need $based_on and $based_on_properties
   - The goal is to test the operation, not how the properties are built. Editing $based_on and $based_on_properties to include only 1 or 2 properties (instead of the whole entity) is a good way to get the comparison function to evaluate to update. If your entity gets out of sync with what is stored in the system database, re-run the collect pipe to get the latest version.
4. $last-modified is using \["now"\]. Use data from the incoming entity instead
   - What data exists in the entity that can be used to construct $last-modified?
      <details> 
      <summary>HINT 1 </summary>
        Tripletex has an array called "changes". This can contain the events CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE.
      </details>
      <details> 
      <summary>HINT 2 </summary>
        $last-modified should be the data of the most recent update or create in that array.
      </details>
5. Add the project datatype
   - What strategies exist for adding a new datatype? 
        <details> 
        <summary>HINT </summary>
          Can you reuse an existing template? 
        </details>
