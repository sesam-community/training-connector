# Tripletex

A Sesam connector for Tripletex

## Structure needed to make the connector workflow function

```
training-connector/
    .authconfig (Set CONSUMER_TOKEN & EMPLOYEE_TOKEN)
    .syncconfig (Set NODE & JWT)
    README.md
    manifest.json (Set and define which templates to use for datatypes)
    templates/

```

## General instruction when editing files.

You should not change the json files within the templates folder locally. The `manifest.json` file you can change locally to reflect which datatypes you want generated in your Sesam subscription when doing your development. 

## Exercises
1. Collect the product data from Tripletex
2. Insert a new Tripletex product (you will need to repost and edit an entity to do this)
3. Update the Tripletex product you inserted (you will need to repost and edit an entity to do this)
4. $last-modified is using \["now"\]. Use data from the incoming entity instead
5. Add the project datatype
   -HINT: can you reuse an existing template?

    - Trace works wonders! You can read about the details on docs
    - Execution Log like always

- To insert an entity the $origin property must be present and the primary_key must be missing
- To update an entity you need $based_on and $based_on_properties
- Example insert
```
