# Tripletex

A Sesam connector for Tripletex

## Structure needed to make the connector workflow function

```
training-connector/
    .authconfig (Set CONSUMER_TOKEN & EMPLOYEE_TOKEN)
    .syncconfig (Set NODE & JWT)
    README.md
    manifest.json (Set and define which templates to use for datatypes)
    templates/

```
## Exercises
1. Collect the product data from Tripletex
2. Insert a new Tripletex product (you will need to repost and edit an entity to do this)
3. Update the Tripletex product you inserted (you will need to repost and edit an entity to do this)
4. $last-modified is using \["now"\]. Use data from the incoming entity instead
5. Add the project datatype

    - Trace works wonders! You can read about the details on docs
    - Execution Log like always

- To insert an entity the $origin property must be present and the primary_key must be missing
- To update an entity you need $based_on and $based_on_properties
- Example insert
```
